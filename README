Toggle Provisioning System
==========================

   Toggle is a modular, open source, provisioning system for Internet
   services, telecommunications, and system administration. Toggle provides
   an abstraction layer between the billing systems (front-end systems) and
   the back-end systems which provide services to end users.  This
   abstraction layer allows either the billing systems or the back-end
   systems to be modified or replaced without requiring all systems to be
   updated. Toggle also enables multiple billing systems to provision
   services on shared accounts in the backend systems. This enables an
   organization which uses disparate billing systems to provide unified user
   names and passwords for services provided by the organization.
