Toggle Provisioning System
==========================

   Toggle is a modular open source provisioning system.  Toggle is designed
   to provide an abstraction layer between one or more billing systems and
   the back-end systems which provide services to end users.  By using an
   abstraction layer, either the billing systems or the back-end systems may
   be modified or replaced without affecting the operation of the other
   system.  The abstraction layer also permits multiple billing systems to
   use the same backend systems in order to provide unified user name and
   passwords for all of the services an organization may provide.
